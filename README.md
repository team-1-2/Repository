## This is a random team and we just post interesting code here.

We just copy and paste stuff we find in github and other sites we found on the internet.

### Rules: 

1) When you add a file here give credit to the creator.
  He deserves it and also put the original link.
  
2) No viruses. If you add a virus here without telling people its a virus you could be sued.

3) All content here has to be 7+ or lower. 

4) Don't mess up or delete ANY of the files.

5) Don't behave like a nimrod here and be nice.
